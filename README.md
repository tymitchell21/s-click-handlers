# Assessment: Click Handlers #

For this activity, you will be creating an interactive web page that gets updated or modified when various buttons are clicked. 

Begin by making a **fork** of this repository. The src directory contains only one file, `index.html`.

If you open that file in your web browser, you will see three numbered sections.

Clicking on the "blue" and "gray" buttons in section 1 will change the color of the square. The other buttons on the page don't do anything ...yet.

Open `index.html` in your code editor. There are three separate sections of JavaScript code embedded within the HTML, enclosed within `<script>` tags.

Inside each of those three sections of code, you will find a JavaScript comment specifying a "TODO".

Each TODO indicates a place where you need to write some additional JavaScript code in order to complete the functionality of the page. Complete all three of the TODOs.

**Edwin the Duck Says:**
_In this exercise, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have all been combined together into a single file. That's OK for a small project like this. In general, though, it's a good practice to separate the markup, stylesheets, and scripts into independent files._

### Math Hint ###

Your reading introduced JavaScript's addition and multiplication operators, `+` and `*` respectively.

The third TODO will require you to figure out whether a number is even or odd.

To determine this, you will use JavaScript's modulus, or remainder, operator, `%`.

The modulus operator gives you the [remainder left over when one number is divided by another](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/division-remainder.html).

In arithmetic, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

-	`3 % 2` = 1 _(hence 3 is odd)_
-	`4 % 2` = 0 _(hence 4 is even)_

### Programming hint ###

Make sure you understand the difference between JavaScript's assignment operator (which updates the value of a variable) and the equality operator (which returns true or false depending on whether two values are the same or not).

### Finishing up ###

Once you have completed all three TODOs, your index.html file should display five buttons, and clicking on any of those buttons should produce the desired behavior.
